<h1>Gold Path - Home Assignment</h1>

## Few key notes:

- in calc.py I infered that the y1(hit height) is always =0
- the link for the web aplication is:https://team-yossi1302-gold-path-home-assignment-main-y24jnq5a6q-ew.a.run.app/
- the link for http request is: https://team-yossi1302-gold-path-home-assignment-main-y24jnq5a6q-ew.a.run.app/api
- you send inputs to the http request by adding ?v0=[input number]&alpha0=[input number]&h0=[input number]
- if you don't send inputs you will get a default output(v0=1 alpha0=1 h0=1)
- the answers for the theoretical questions are in a word file in this repo
